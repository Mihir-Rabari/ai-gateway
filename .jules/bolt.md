## 2025-04-12 - Batched Redis Operations in Routing Service
**Learning:** Checking multiple provider health statuses using `Promise.all` with individual `redis.get` calls creates an N+1 query pattern that adds unnecessary latency.
**Action:** When querying multiple keys from Redis (especially in critical paths like routing health checks), use `redis.mget` to fetch all values in a single round-trip. Ensure the Redis mock in tests is updated to support `mget`.
